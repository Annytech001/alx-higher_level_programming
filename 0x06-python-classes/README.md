0x06. Python - Classes and Object
A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that objects of that class will have. Classes are used to encapsulate data and functionality into a single unit.
An object is an instance of a class. It's a concrete instantiation of the class, representing a specific entity or concept. Objects have attributes that store data and methods that define their behavior.
