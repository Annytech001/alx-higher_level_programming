JavaScript objects, scopes, and closures are fundamental concepts in the language. Let's briefly explore each of these concepts:
objects are complex data types that allow you to store and organize data in key-value pairs. Objects can contain properties and methods. Properties are variables attached to the object, and methods are functions that are part of the object.

JavaScript has function-level scope. Variables declared within a function are only accessible within that function. However, starting from ECMAScript 6 (ES6), JavaScript also supports block-level scoping using the let and const keywords.

Closures are a feature in JavaScript where a function retains access to variables from its outer (enclosing) scope even after the outer function has finished execution. This allows for powerful patterns like creating private variables and functions
